Check out my other branch - git switch into it - for the jQuery way- another way to display "more info" button using event.currentTarget on every "more info" button instead of using Bootstrap's' data attributes to toggle down the crypto "more info" box.

Added photo from linkedin for favicon

Important:

Have a premade css file to see clearly the borders and background color of all the rows and columns.

Always draw out your html first.

Then draw out where your API data should go.

Additional important:

Create github repo, vscode, open git kraken to see GUI progress

If you click the more info button in less than 2 minutes the data will be sent from local storage and no calls to the API will be made. But more than 2 minutes the local storage with that specific coin will dissapear and a new call to the API will be made once more info is clicked.
